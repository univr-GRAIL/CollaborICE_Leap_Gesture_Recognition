 # Leap Motion Gesture Recognition

## Installation

### Install Dependencies
Follow the instructions to install the LeapC Python bindings from:
[LeapC Python Bindings](https://github.com/ultraleap/leapc-python-bindings/tree/main)

## Execution on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run the following commands:
   ```powershell
   usbipd list  # Check the ID of the USB device
   usbipd bind --busid <your-busid>
   ```

## Execution on Ubuntu
### Build the Executable
Inside `colcon_ws`, run:
```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
. install/setup.bash
```

### Run the Application
Run the following ROS2 commands:
```bash
ros2 run leap_gesture_recognition leap_gesture_recognition
ros2 run leap_motion leap_motion
```

### View Published Topics
To check the published joint data:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /leapmotion/joints
```

## Tracked Hand Joint Data
The system tracks 3D positions for key hand joints, structured as follows:

- **Palm & Wrist:** Palm position, rotation (quaternion), and wrist position.
- **Fingers:** Each finger (thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky) has:
  - Metacarpal
  - Proximal
  - Intermediate
  - Distal

Each joint is represented by its `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates.

### Example Naming Convention
- `left_palm_x`, `left_palm_y`, `left_palm_z`
- `left_thumb_proximal_x`, `left_thumb_proximal_y`, `left_thumb_proximal_z`
- `right_index_distal_x`, `right_index_distal_y`, `right_index_distal_z`

This structure applies to both hands (`left_` and `right_`).
